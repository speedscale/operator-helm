Excellent, you've built the helm chart from the latest version of speedmgmt.
Now we need to update speedscale/partner-charts and submit a PR to the upstream
rancher/partner-charts.

Update the fork branch of speedscale/partner-charts with 'git pull https://github.com/rancher/partner-charts main-source'

Details at https://github.com/rancher/partner-charts/tree/main-source.

The commands should look something like this:
$ vim packages/speedscale-operator/package.yaml # to bump the URL and packageVersion
$ PACKAGE=speedscale-operator make prepare
$ make validate
$ # git commit and push one or more times
$ make validate
$ make clean
$ submit PR
"
